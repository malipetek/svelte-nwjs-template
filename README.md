# Svelte NW.js App

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps with [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/). It lives at https://github.com/malipetek/svelte-nwjs-template.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit malipetek/svelte-nwjs-template svelte-nwjs-app
cd svelte-nwjs-app
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [NW.js](https://nwjs.io) installed.*

*You also need to have `nw` in your systems path. Which means when you type `nw ./` in your terminal when you are in your project folder, it should be running your project.*


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-nwjs-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) and NWJS:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see your NWJS window opening and your app running inside it. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
